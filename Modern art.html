<p align="center">As MoMA Learning explains, Modern Art can be traced all<br> the way back to the Industrial Revolution! Art used to be <br>created for the wealthy, of the wealthy; <br>however, going more into the 19th century and thanks to <br>Sigmund Freud's, 'The Interpretation of Dreams', artists <br>began creating art exploring their own subconcious experiences. <br>This was done using many different mediums, techniques, and materials.</p>
